minTCP
======

A minimalist TCP stack written in ANSI C.

This needs to be run on a Linux machine with root access. Idealy on a network interface that does not have an IP address associated with it.

Usage
-----

	./minTCP eth1 192.168.0.99 255.255.255.0

Why
---

If this can be done in Phython (see [teeceepee](https://github.com/jvns/teeceepee)) then it can be done in C!
